			<h1> Galentine's Day </h1>
			<h5> With its humble roots as a small fictional holiday in <i>Parks and Rec</i> celebrating Leslie's ladyfriends, February 13th has evolved into a real holiday commemorating platonic love and friendships and honoring female power.  </h5>

<p>Beyond simply being the day before Valentine's Day, February 13th has morphed into a holiday in its own right. Despite being a pseudo-holiday whose origins date back to only 11 years prior, Galentine's Day has evolved from a fictional ceremony to a very real celebration of womanhood and friendship. </p>
<p>Aired on February 11, 2010, the 16th episode of the second season of <i>Parks and Rec </i> was appropriately named "Galentine's Day." Leslie Knope, who may be the purest person in the world with enough love and kindness to suffocate Cupid, is unsurprisingly the mastermind behind the holiday she dubbed "the best day of the year." Giving presents (a gift bag with hand-crocheted flower pens, a mosaic portrait of each of them made with the crushed bottles of their favorite diet soda, and a 5,000-word essay celebrating their awesomeness) to her ladyfriends, Leslie tops the celebration off with lots of breakfast foods and even more frittatas. "Ladies celebrating ladies," she describes, "Itâ€™s like Lilith Fair, minus the angst."  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYv1zjBOMew" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Galentine's Day, if anything, is the embodiment of Leslie Knope in holiday form. With the ultimate celebration of femininity and friendship, the somewhat excessive gift exchange, the overwhelming burst of energy and love, and of course the aggressive consumption of waffles, the holiday contains the best of Leslie and <i>Parks and Rec</i>, and so, it really isn't a surprise that its legacy continues well past the show's conclusion in 2015.</p>
<p>Without letting my overanalytical, over-political side out, America loves its holidays. Many people have criticized anniversaries like Valentine's Day for being a corporate ploy to capitalize on love and enforce unnecessary purchases, and for some part, they're absolutely right. Corporations like money, and Americans like spending. Galentine's Day, however, seems to be no exception. Stores have already capitalized on the holiday's popularity, pushing out Galentine's Day-themed gifts and sales. Every February since the show's airing, #Galentine'sDay trends on Twitter and Instagram with companies celebrating the holiday with promo codes and not-so-smooth advertising. </p>

<p>And in a culture where feminism and equality are becoming increasingly valued and prevalent, this holiday and its embodiment of one of the most iconic champions for women's rights is unsurprisingly a popular tradition, especially among young women. Sometimes, girls just want to hang out and celebrate other girls, and it's perfectly fine because we deserve to be celebrated (especially after centuries of misogyny and sexism). Proudly pink and feminine, the holiday celebrates women in all of its cheesy but spirited glory.
Moreover, placed right before Valentine's Day with its emphasis on romantic love, Galentine's Day reminds us of the importance and value of platonic love, which can be stronger and just as beautiful as traditional romance. And while some definitely don't need an excuse to celebrate and treat their friends to unconditional love and gifts, the holiday does provide an amazing opportunity to demonstrate gratitude and love to the ones who were always there to support you.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, the success of this holiday is not surprising. Parks and Rec may have ended, but its legacy will live on. And Galentine's Day and the ever-prevailing goodness of Leslie Knope will live on with it. So raise a glass of frittatas (or some orange juice) and put some extra whipped cream on those waffles, and remember that women, Leslie Knope, and breakfast foods are and will always be awesome. </p>
