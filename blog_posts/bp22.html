<p>Creed Bratton possesses such a chaotic and weird energy that quickly made him a fan favorite. With a mysterious past and a bizarre personality, he lurks mainly in the background of <i>The Office</i> but still manages to steal the spotlight with his eccentric actions and uncanny dialogue. </p>
<p> In the episode <i>The Job</i> (S3E24), we are introduced to an intimate look inside the enigma's brain. <i>Creed Thoughts</i> is the "blog" that Ryan Howard made for the one and only William Charles Schneider. Creed proudly (incorrectly) recites the web address ("www.creedthoughts.gov.www\creedthoughts.") for his blog, which is merely a Word document with a fake address at the top. Ryan states that he wanted to protect the world from Creed's brain, a noble cause since the entries are "shocking, even for the internet."

<p>However, in case you did want to take a glimpse inside his brain, <i>Creed Thoughts</i> is an actual blog on the NBC website, ghost-written by Jason Kessler, from 2007 to 2008. However, while the blog is not on the website anymore, it can still be accessed through the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080927130429/http://blog.nbc.com/CreedThoughts" aria-label="Internet Achieve, Creed Thoughts blog" target="creedarchive"> Internet Archive</a> or the <a href="https://creedthoughtsgov.com/" aria-label="link to the fan-based site" target="fan">fan-created site</a> that convienently collected all of his posts.</p>
<p>There's an entry every week from May 13, 2007 to August 24, 2008—a solid year's worth of material that adds up to a total of 67 entries. </p>
<p>Here's the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080924005907/http://blog.nbc.com/CreedThoughts/2008/05/11-week/" target="maypost" aria-label="Creed Thoughts post from 5/15/2008">post from May 15, 2008</a>—almost 13 years from today:
<br>
"Between the ages of 18 and 31, I completely lost my sense of smell. I was using this nose spray that was supposed to make me a better lover and after about a week of using the stuff, I couldn't smell a damn thing. It might have been all of the ground-up tiger particles that were supposed to really jump-start your manhood, but who knows? Anyway, I didn't get my sniffer back until a few days after my 31st birthday when I was walking past this Ukrainian deli and thought to myself "Am I smelling kovbasa?" Indeed I was. I launched into that sausage like there was no tomorrow because it was the first thing I could really taste in years. Ever since then, I've been really aware of how important smell is to me.
<br> 
That's why I'm proud to announce the arrival of my new fragrance, "CreedScents." It's a mixture of my favorite smells: gasoline, three-day-old cigarettes, cash money, pineapple, bleach, and dirt. It smells awesome. When you walk around, people stop and look at you as if to say "Is that you that I'm smelling?" Well, folks, yes it is, and now, for the first time ever, you can smell like me, too. I'm personally bottling it in 100% recycled water bottles that still have their original labels. Just hook up a little squirt attachment to the top (sold separately) and spray away! You can smell like Creed! Your pet can smell like Creed! Your home can smell like Creed! Your car can smell like Creed! Even your kids can smell like Creed! Buy some CreedScents now!
<br>
Just a little legal disclaimer: Don't drink CreedScents. Don't use CreedScents as a cleaning liquid. CreedScents is not intended to touch the human skin. If your skin comes into contact with CreedScents, immediately scrub the infected area for roughly one hour or else your skin may begin to melt. CreedScents should not be inhaled. Once in the bloodstream, CreedScents can do serious damage to both your brain and most of your major organs. CreedScents should not be used as a narcotic, although it functions as one if distilled into a gel-cap. Please do not distill CreedScents into gel-caps, as the narcotic it becomes is equivalent to a lethal combination of absinthe, lithium, and hemlock. You may get high for a minute, but you'll be dead forever. By purchasing CreedScents, you agree to release me, Creed Bratton, from any legal action whatsoever. Also, any problems not mentioned here that arise from the use of CreedScents shall be deemed "implied risks" and cannot be used against me, Creed Bratton, in any type of lawsuit.
<br>Stop sitting on your fat ass and buy some CreedScents today!" </p>

<p>Personally, CreedScents sounds like an <i>amazing</i> idea and 11/10 would buy. My favorite line in the excerpt—and this is hard because there's just <i>so</i> many to choose from—is "You may get high for a minute, but you'll be dead forever." He makes a very, very convincing argument (who wouldn't want to smell like three-day-old cigarettes?) with interesting rhetorical choices that I wish I could have written my AP Lang essay about this.</p>

<p> So, in conclusion, <i>Creed Thoughts</i> is an actual blog that is just as chaotic and weird as Creed. It is now my favorite website of all time and has provided me with a good amount of reading material to contemplate.
