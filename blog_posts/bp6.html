			<h1> Stress Relief </h1>
			<h5> No episode is quite as chaotic and legendary as this one. From its cold open to its satisfying ending and every little detail in between, <i>Stress Relief</i> quickly established itself as one of, if the <i>the</i>, best <i>Office</i> episode ever. </h5>

				<p>It starts with what is possibly the best cold open ever. </p>
				<p>What can only be described as amazingly chaotic, Dwight simulates an office fire, causing unruly disorder and hysterical hijinks. Michaels gifts us with the beautiful, gif-able quote of "Oh my God! Okay, it's happening! Everybody stay calm!" and smashes a window to call for help. Kevin resorts to looting the vending machine. Angela tells Oscar to "save Bandit!", the small cat she keeps hidden in a drawer and subsequently throws through the vent when Oscar ignores her plea. Jim and Andy try and fail to use a printer to jam their way through the locked doors. And in the midst of the smoke and the chaos, the cold open ends with Stanley having a heart attack, prompting Michael, against the advice of his co-workers, to give him CPR and shoves a wallet in his mouth.

				</p>
				<p>The cold open, while delightfully chaotic in its own right, set the plot for the next two episodes. We get the brilliant CPR scene, in which Dwight, in true Hannibal Lecter fashion, cuts off the CPR dummy's face and wears it. Dwight, forced to apologize for his actions, does so with his statement of regret, reading simply, "I state my regret."</p>
				<p>Michael realizes that he's the cause of everyone's stress during the mediation scene, ending the first episode with him realizing, "So… it wasn’t Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you’re the killer… it’s uh… great twist. Great twist." </p>
				<p>This sets up the plot for the next episode, in which Michael decides that the best way to deal with all this stress is with a roast of himself, and bring us to my personal favorite scene of the episode. Michael, despite being well-intentioned and a fan-favorite, tends to have rather unrealistic views about his own importance. I don't know, as someone who thinks that he's incredibly overrated, it was satisfying to see his ego get knocked down a few pegs. We have Oscar's anger-fueled and exasperated rant, Andy's catchy “What I Hate About You” song, Pam's brilliant iPod Shuffle roast, and what may be the most <i>ooh</i>-worthy and well-deserved moment of the scene, Dwight calling Michael a "pathetic, short little man" who doesn't "even have any friends, any family, or any land!" <iframe style="float:left; display:block;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OS-utbiLy6o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
				<p>With his feelings hurt, Michael takes a personal day, dons a black turtleneck and peacoat, and goes to the park to contemplate life and throw slices of bread to the ducks. He returns to the office and proceeds to roast each of his subordinates. Everyone's a little startled and a little hurt until Stanley, the inspiration for all of this, starts laughing uncontrollably. </p>
				<p>A notable side plot in these two episodes involves Pam's parents, whose deteriorating relationship has led to Pam's dad staying at her and Jim's house for the past couple of days. Andy invites Pam and Jim to watch <i>Mrs. Albert Hannaday</i> (starring Jack Black), during which the two comment about the former's parents while Andy confusedly thinks that they're remarking about the movie. He believes they're movie geniuses and decides that he's not cut out to be a film critic. After talking with Jim, Pam's dad decides to get a divorce, leaving Pam bewildered and insecure about what exactly he said. She discovers, however, that Jim has been deeply in love with her since the beginning, something that her father never felt for her mother. She states that while most children expect their parents to be soulmates, their children “will be right about that.” I don't know, I just thought it was neat. Definitely did not make me shed a metaphorical tear. </p>
				<p>The two-part episode was definitely eventful, but it contains everything that truly makes <i>The Office</i>, well, <i>The Office</i>. Chaotic in the very best way while being filled with sweet moments of human connection and dozens of quotable lines and out-of-context gifs. Everything in the show is always seemingly a few steps away from disaster, and this episode really captures that surreal feel well in the best whirlwind way. It's an episode that is truly rewatchable, every minute filled with that pure unique <i>The Office</i> essence. </p>
