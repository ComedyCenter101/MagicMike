							<h2>A Benihana Christmas (S3E10/11)</h2>
							<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
								<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZlak_aj7Yw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</div>
							<p>
							Everything about this episode is kind of perfect. Carol (rightfully) breaks up with Michael, and to take his mind off of it, Andy brings Michael to Benihana. Meanwhile, Pam and Karen form an unexpected friendship and team up to create the <i>The Committee to Plan Parties</i> (as inaugurated by Jim's <i>The Committee to Determine the Validity of the Two Committees</i>) and their own party, rivaling Angela's <i>Party Planning Committee</i>'s Christmas party. Andy and Michael bring two waitresses from Benihana (neither of whom were their waitress) to the parties, and unable to tell them apart, Michael draws a mark on his date because "all waitresses look alike." The two separate parties eventually combine, resulting in a somewhat wholesome but very drunk scene.

							<h2>Dwight Christmas (S9E9)</h2>
							<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
								<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVx8yKZ3btY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</div>
							<p>
							The last Christmas special, this episode doesn't feature Michael, Ryan, or Kelly but still manages to hold its own. Angela forgets to plan a party and Phyllis conveniently doesn't remind her, so Dwight hosts an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch–themed Christmas. He dresses up as Belsnickel, a scarier and much less jolly version of Santa, brings Dutch food, and plays "Impish or Admirable". Jim leaves the party early to go to Philadelphia, upsetting Dwight, but comes back to spend more time with Pam. Dwight's thrilled and embraces him in a moment that truly shows their wholesome, brotherly bond. A major highlight of the episode is Darrell who becomes increasingly drunk, thinking that Jim forgot to include him in the new job in Philadelphia. Upon finding out that Jim did set up an interview, he spins around and epically crashes down on the catering table. The episode isn't perfect, but it's definitely sweet and the perfect last holiday episode to end the show.

							<h2>Citizen Knope (S4E10)</h2>
							<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
								<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01-46MChgqE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</div>
							<p>
							While <i>Parks and Rec</i> doesn't have holiday specials as great as other comedies, <i>Citizen Knope</i> is still definitely heartwarming and wholesome. It isn't entirely focused on the holiday spirit, with Christmas acting more like a subplot, but it does feature thoughtful gifts, lots of jokes, and touching moments of friendship and chosen family. Leslie, restless in her two-week suspension, creates the Parks Committee of Pawnee. The rest of the office brainstorm gift ideas after receiving sweet and personal gifts from Leslie (a highlight is Ron's gift that closes his office doors with a press of a button, something that he tearfully describes as "so beautiful"). While it may not be a great <i>holiday</i> episode, at least not compared to those of <i>The Office</i>, <i>The Golden Girls</i>, and <i>I Love Lucy</i>, it definitely is a brilliant episode with the appearances of Marshmellow Ron, "salgar," Ben's use of "resigning in disgrace," and the gingerbread city hall.

							<h2>Ron and Diane (S5E9)</h2>
							<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
								<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6pCKUzWBRdk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</div>
							<p>
							This episode is truly wonderful, blending heartwarming family moments with hijinks and comedy in the best way possible. Ron takes Diane as his date to a woodworking award show, and Tammy II ever so conveniently arrives to seduce Ron. Leslie, in a hilarious testament to her loyalty and devotion to Ron, engages Tammy in a very entertaining game of cat-and-mouse that includes both of them fishing for car keys in the dumpster and ends with Leslie in a car trunk and Tammy arrested. Ron also gives Diane the honor of meeting his counterpart Duke Silver and gracing us with some jazz. We also get to see more of Gerry/Larry/Jerry/Terry's beautiful family and finally meet his daughters at the Gergich's annual holiday party. His sweet and heartwarming personal life more than makes up for his unpleasant work life.

							<h2>Yippie Kayak (S3E10)</h2>
							<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
								<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hAvVQVCF2os" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

							<p>
							While not as brilliant as their Halloween episodes, all of <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i>'s holiday specials are jam-packed with action and humor while being original and heartfelt. This episode is legendary in particular for its <i>Die Hard</i> homage when Jake, Charles, and Gina find themselves in a hostage situation, something that's a dream come true for Peralta ("Oh my God, it’s real-life Die Hard! I mean … oh no, crime!"). Meanwhile, Holt, Rosa, and Amy go polar-bear swimming, the latter joining only to prove that's she's tough despite getting cold ridiculously easy. Terry has to deal with his terrible brother-in-law Zeke at the Jefford's holiday dinner, but before leaving to deal with the hostage situation, he rightfully tells him off. Everything about this episode is amazing, from Charles butchering the <i>Die Hard</i> catchphrase, saying "Yippie kayak, other buckets!," to Gina getting her Christmas wish of making a hairspray flamethrower. The Vulture ends up stealing the show with his general douchery, telling Terry "Happy Kwanzaa” and failing to prove his authority with a hilarious interaction with a sniper.

							<h2>Captain Latvia (S4E10)</h2>
							<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
								<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6KvRRHnnsc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

							Another action-packed episode, Jake helps Boyle track down Nikolaj's favorite toy, a Captain Latvia (who can talk to possums despite there being no possums in actual Latvia) action figure, for his first Christmas. Meanwhile, the rest of the precinct prepare to battle against the MTA in the caroling contest. They end up enlisting Patrick after hearing him sing in the holding cell. The competition does not go well, with Patrick drunkenly falling off the stage. While the rest of the squad is crestfallen and plots revenge against the MTA, Scully reminds them of the true meaning of Christmas and leaves to go caroling by himself. Jake and Boyle end up facing a Latvian criminal ring, and the two go undercover to find the missing toy. Charles, motivated by his determination to keep his promise to his son, impressively shatters glass, engages in a fistfight while hilariously speaking sweet Latvian, and wiggles out of his pants when stuck, but is ultimately unable to retrieve the toy. Jake, however, presents Nikolaj with a policeman action figure, explaining that Nikolaj doesn't need a toy of Captain Latvia when his favorite hero is his father. The episode ends, quite sweetly, with the squad joining Scully and caroling outside of Boyle's house, and despite their lack of harmony, it's still a very heartfelt moment.
