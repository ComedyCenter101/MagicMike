			<h1> Jim's Best Pranks on Dwight </h1>
			<h5> <i>The Office</i> would not be, well, <i>The Office</i> without the constant chaotic but very amusing workplace hijinks that occur. In that beautiful mess of brilliant mayhem is constant pranks that Jim pulls on the very gullible Dwight. Of course, there are some <i>amazing</i> pranks over the course of the series, but here's five of <i>some</i> of the best ones! </h5>

							<h2>Jello Stapler</h2>

							<p>An oldie, but definitely a goodie. It's not the most elaborate prank Jim has ever pulled, but it was the first one and an <i>amazing</i> introduction to the dynamic between the two. The jello stapler prank became a staple of the <i>The Office</i> and you can even find a <a target="blank" href="https://www.boxlunch.com/product/funko-pop-television-the-office-dwight-schrute-with-jello-stapler-vinyl-figure/13032386.html">Funko-Pop</a> of Dwight holding the infamous treat.</p>

							<h2>Dwight's Speech</h2>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ilE4lr9Qb3A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>
							There are many pranks that are much more elaborate than this one in the second season, but the result of Jim's "tips" on public speaking is phenomenal. While Dwight's speech did end up a lot like Mussolini's, it was definitely inspiring, and he would make an <i>amazing</i> dictator, for the salesmen of Northeastern Pennsylvania at least.

							<h2>Impersonating Dwight</h2>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WaaANll8h18" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>
							This may very well be the most iconic prank ever. The outfit is spot-on, the impersonation is perfection, <i>and</i> the scene gave us <i>two</i> amazing quotes: "Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica‚Äù and "Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!" 
							</p>

							<h2>Bill Buttlicker</h2>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1QQBB3cwNM0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>
							Everything about this is just pure perfection. Bill Buttlicker. Dwight being "aggressive, hostile, and definitely difficult." William M. Buttlicker. Michael falling for an imaginary million-dollar sale. Dwight being offended that he's fired because of that million-dollar sale. William M. Buttlicker, whose family <i>built</i> this country. It's all just perfection.

						<h2>Asian Jim</h2>

						<p>
						Asian Jim may be one of the best cold open to ever grace the show, and Randall Park plays Jim's mannerism <i>perfectly</i>. The clothes, facial expression, the look into the camera, and the icing on top is the family photograph. Jim Halpert did not need to go all out, but he did, and we appreciate him for it.
