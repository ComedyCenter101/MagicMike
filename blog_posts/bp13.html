			<h1> Escouade 99: Brookyln Non-Non  </h1>
			<h5> Or in which there is a French-Canadian remake of <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i>, and the internet and cast have... thoughts. Like looking into a freakish alternate dimension, the remake is shot-to-shot similar but somehow still misses the mark. </h5>

			<p><i>Escouade 99</i> ("escouade" means "squad" in French) dropped its trailer in August 2020, and fans collectively lost their minds. <iframe style="float:right; padding:15px; display: block" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dL0HuUNhnA0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
			<p>The team behind the actual <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> approved a Canadian-remake of the show in 2019, and <i>Escouade 99</i> officially debuted September 17 on the streaming channel <i>Club Illico</i>. It currently has 13 episodes for its first and current season and features Micka√´l Gouin (who interestingly starred on <i>SNL Quebec</i> in 2016 like his American counterpart Andy Samberg who was a notable cast of the American <i>SNL</i> for 7 seasons), Bianca Gervais, Myl√®ne Mackay, Widemir Normil, and Guy Jodoin. </p>
			<p>The reactions to the trailer were rather mixed. While most fans were surprised by the existence of the remake and somewhat weirded out by the um... interesting components of it, the cast's reaction was considerably more negative. </p>
			<p>Melissa Fumero, who plays Amy Santiago, was especially disappointed by the lack of diversity in the Canadian version. What's notable and somewhat groundbreaking about <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i> is its effortless incorporation of diverse characters who aren't reduced to just their race. However, <i>Escouade 99</i>, on the other hand, has whitewashed Amy and Rosa, two Latina characters, into Fanny (Myl√®ne Mackay) and Rosalie (Bianca Gervais), two (I don't want to say bland since I haven't watched it) white, non-Latina detectives. While Raymond C√©lestin and Jeff Bourjoly (the counterparts of Raymond Holt and Terry Jeffords) are thankfully still black, making it considerably more diverse than most of the shows in Quebec, Fumero is still (righteously) disappointed that the network didn't take the opportunity to cast any BIPOC, especially considering the city's large Maghreban, Asian, and indigenous communities.</p>

				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot, and it basically comes down to this... while I understand the Latina population is v small in Quebec (&amp; how many of them are funny actors?) the Amy n Rosa roles could‚Äôve gone to ANY BIPOC so it‚Äôs disappointing to see that missed opportunity.</p>&mdash; Melissa Fumero (@melissafumero) <a href="https://twitter.com/melissafumero/status/1296873174563295232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lastly, if the show is successful I hope the creators take that opportunity to hire more BIPOC in supporting and guest roles. üòò‚úåüèΩ</p>&mdash; Melissa Fumero (@melissafumero) <a href="https://twitter.com/melissafumero/status/1296875876303298560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

			<p> In addition, Fumero also notes that they oversexualized Fanny in the remake, forcing Amy, the resident awkward but totally badass nerd into a role that doesn't really fit her. And I would have to agree, especially since the nurse outfit that Fanny dawns in the trailer seems out of character (and kind of made me uncomfortable). 
			 </p>
			<p>Now, my personal opinion. It's... weird. It is so <i>weird</i>, man. It's difficult to describe exactly what part of the trailer makes me uneasy, other than to just gesture wildly at all of it, so I won't. However, I don't see myself subscribing to a Canadian streaming channel anytime soon nor do I see myself watching an entire show in French (especially considering I have not picked up the language as well as I should've in my two years of high school French), so for now, I guess I, and the other thousands of <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i> fans, will have to "settle" (putting that in quotes because the original, in my totally objective opinion, is far superior) for binging the show a dozen more times. </p>
