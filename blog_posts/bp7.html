			<h1> What Happened to Mark Brendanawicz? </h1>
			<h5> <i>Parks and Rec</i> has introduced us to a variety of unforgettable characters, but one of the seemingly main characters has been utterly and completely forgettable. Yup, Mark Brendanawicz. Fans and the show alike have seemingly forgotten his existence with his character disappearing after the second season. What went wrong? </h5>

				<p>Mark Brendanawicz. Played by Paul Schneider, he appears only in the first two seasons of the seven-season show, and in a cast of brilliant and exceptional characters, Brendanawiczis blandly unremarkable. With his disappearance after the second season, it was easy, way too easy, to forget his character ever existed. And beyond just the fans, the show too seemed to forget, never bringing the character back for a quick cameo in the later seasons. Mark Brendanawicz didn't just disappear; his character just completely ceased to exist. <iframe style="float:right" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQ-LXepDHUU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
				<p>What exactly went wrong? When Leslie first introduced Mark in the first episode, she hyped him up to be this incredible and fascinating being, but all we got was a straight white man who hates his job. <i>Parks and Rec</i> is filled with lively and interesting characters with extremist personalities (Ron with his stoicism, April and her apathy, and Andy in all his himbo glory), but Mark was just utterly and plainly boring. He didn't have any exciting personality traits; if anything, he was probably the most normal person on the show. And in any other situation, that's perfectly fine and ideal, but his normalcy just does not translate well on TV, especially when contrasted with a colorful and charming cast. </p>
				<p>Taking a couple of steps back, the first season of <i>Parks and Rec</i> was rather rough, so rough that the renewal of the show seemed unlikely. When NBC (thankfully) picked up the show for a second season, adjustments had to be made. While the show had first seemed to copy the successful formula of <i>The Office</i>, the second season was where that unique <i>Parks and Rec</i> feel truly started to develop.
				<p>With those swift adjustments in-between seasons, Mark's character and presence also promptly changed. Where he was a rather jaded and somewhat self-absorbed government worker in Season One (like a poorly executed imitation of Jim Halpert in <i>The Office</i>), he becomes slightly less pessimistic and indifferent. However, where he was a prominent cast member in the first few episodes, Mark has few plotlines in the second season other than his ill-fated relationship with Ann. <iframe style="float: left;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ri9fyZK9wZE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</p>
				<p>And as the show found its footing, the need for Mark's character diminished along with his screentime. Ron Swanson proved to be an exceptionally brilliant character, and with Andy promoted to a series regular and dramatic changes to Leslie's personality, Mark's character became obsolete and unnecessary in a cast of comedic geniuses. The arrival of Ben and Chris just added insult to injury with the audience perceiving their presence higher than they ever would with Brendanawicz. In addition, Ben just seemed to effortlessly (and hilariously) fill that role of the realist, relatively normal straight man that Mark couldn't, and he did it while adding his own unique and quirky traits to the mix.
				</p>
				<p>
				 Officially, Paul Schneider decided to leave the over creative differences with his character. He had signed up for a specific role in mind that was swiftly changed between seasons. And uncertain about the direction this new character was supposed to take, Schneider knew his time in Pawnee was ticking away. He states in an interview with <a href="https://screencrush.com/paul-schneider-interview/" target="interview">Screencrush</a>, "I was very happy for the experience to be involved and those guys really figured out what it is they're doingâ€¦ But I've never been contacted about [returning] nor have I any interest in going back." So with the actor himself uninterested in his role, and the audience caught up in the much more exciting arrival of Ben and Chris, it's really no surprise that Brendanawicz had to call it Brendana-quits.
