			<h1> John Krasinski: SNL </h1>
			<h5> John Krasinski hosted the first show of Saturday Night Live of the year, and, of course, there were tons of <i>The Office</i> jokes. From kissing Pete Davidson (aka Pam) to lyricizing <i>The Office</i> theme song, this episode proved that while Krasinski may have moved onto other roles, he will always be good old Jim in our eyes. </h5>

				<p>Huge disclaimer: I am a huge SNL fan. Pete Davidson deserves all the hugs in the world, and Bowen Yang is critically underrated. That being said, John Krasinski hosting the 10th episode of their 46th season was truly a gift. Krasinski was originally scheduled to host last season, but amid the coronavirus pandemic and the world bursting into flames, that appearance was rescheduled to last Saturday. Featuring Machine Gun Kelly as the musical guest, the first episode of the year was, just like <i>The Office</i>, a glorious moment to shut off our brains from the chaos of the world and laugh a little. </p>
				<h3>The Monolouge</h5>
				<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5thGfg7CsUU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>While declaring his love for the show and his children's love of Paw Patrol, Krasinski is interrupted by Alex Moffat asking him/Jim to "do the Office" and "where's Pam?" and responds with some confusion and a "Pam's a fictional character, and that is where she is." A few seconds later, while describing his wife Emily Blunt's hosting of the show a few seasons prior, Krasinski is once again interrupted, this time by Ego Nwodim's question of “You look different” and her request to stop working out (because "Jim is soft"). Immediately after, Kenan Thompson (absolute legend, we stan) asks another non-question question of "Kiss Pam." </p>
				<p>Now the fun part. Pete Davidson comes out, acting as the voice of reason and getting painful real when explaining that "everyone’s been stuck inside for a year watching <i>The Office</i> nonstop, so Jim and Pam are like really real for them." But after pressure from Moffat, Nwodim, and Thompson, Krasinski proceeds to make out with Pete who takes on the mantle of "Pam" but not before giving the camera a classic Jim look (fulfilling Pete's <a href="https://youtu.be/0UKPjauMKkA?t=116" target="pete">request</a> of being placed in more sketches where he gets to kiss the host). </p>	
				<p> As proved by Moffat, Nwodim, and Thompson and the overwhelming <i>The Office</i> comments on the video, while John Krasinski may have moved on to other projects, he will never be able to let go of the role that launched him into stardom. It doesn't matter if he's Lee Abbott (<i>The Quiet Place</i>) or Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy's <i>Jack Ryan</i>) because he's always going to be Jimothy Halpert in our eyes. </p>	
				<h3>Opening Credits Songs</h3>

				<p>Honestly, the entire sketch feels like it was written as an excuse to get John Krasinski to sing his own lyrics to <i>The Office</i>. With lines like "Scranton, Scranton, Scranton, Scranton, Scranton, Scranton, Scranton, Scranton, Scranton / That’s where we all live and work " and “There’s Dwight, he’s the bad guy / And the hero’s name is Jim,” the lyrics somehow capture that goofy, somewhat dry humor that makes <i>The Office</i> so lovable while letting Krasinski's musical talents shine. </p>
				<p> While <i>The Office</i> theme was most definitely the highlight of the sketch, some other notable theme songs include <a href="https://youtu.be/-vX9XxTAFwM?t=31" target="clip">Melissa Villaseñor's song</a> ("Chess and drugs and drugs and chess") for the Netflix show <i>Queen's Gambit</i> and <a href="https://youtu.be/-vX9XxTAFwM?t=89" target="clip">Pete Davidson's vocals</a> for <i>Succession</i> ("Huh? What? Huh? What?").</p>
