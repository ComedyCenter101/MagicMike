			<h1> The Office of Brookyln </h1>
			<h5> <i>The Office</i> has some of the most notable and memorable cast, and a few of them made a brief cameo in <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i>! While not as many as in <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, it's still interesting to see some familiar faces! </h5>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img alt="Helms as Jack Danger" src="images/bp5/jack.jpg">
						<h3>Ed Helms:</h3>
						<p> He plays the lovable but slightly obnoxious Andy Bernard, a salesman, a regional manager, and a notable Cornell alumnus. While Helms plays one of the main characters in <i>The Office</i>, he only makes a brief cameo in <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> as Jack Danger (pronounced "Donger"), an arrogant agent of the United States Postal Inspection Service. While Andy is relatively harmless (or at least until the last season), Danger/Donger put Jake and Charles at risk with his incompetence, spitefulness, and condescension. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img alt="Nunez as Dr. Porp" src="images/bp5/porp.jpg">
						<h3>Oscar Nunez: </h3>
						<p> Nunez plays Oscar Martinez, one of the three accountants on <i>The Office</i>. While his role there is only as a side character, he makes an even smaller cameo than Ed Helms, appearing in <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i> for only a few minutes as Dr. Porp, who tells Jake and Captain Holt that they have mumps, in the amazing Season Three episode <i>9 Days</i>. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img alt="Flannery as Marge" src="images/bp5/marge.jpg">
						<h3>Kate Flannery:</h3>
						<p> Another side character, Flannery plays Meredith Palmer, who's in charge of purchasing and supplier relations but just mostly plays solitaire all day. She too makes a cameo in <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i> as Marge Bronigan or "Mean Marge," the scary head of the Facilities Department who righteously deserves her nickname. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img alt="Bornheimer's brief cameo" src="images/bp5/adman.jpg">
						<h3>Kyle Bornheimer:</h3>
						<p>Flipping the switch a little, Bornheimer is a little more known for his role on <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i> as Teddy Ramos, Amy's ex-boyfriend who has a bad habit of repeatedly proposing to her (including at her wedding and while she was pregnant and he was married). He has a small, blink-and-you'll-miss-it role as one of two ad company reps who helped make the Dunder-Mifflin ad in <i>The Office</i>. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="listthing middlething">
					<img alt="Doug Judy and Jake" src="images/bp5/doug.jpg">
					<h3>Craig Robinson:</h3>
					<p>A man notable in both shows, Robinson plays Darryl Philbin in <i>The Office</i>, the warehouse foreman turned the Head of Shipping and Distribution turned Athlead employee who is always just a little bit done with life. On <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i>, he's Doug Judy or the infamous Pontiac Bandit, guilty of stealing over 200 Pontiacs (hence the nickname) and one case of dog fraud (sold a Pekingese dog but "t'was a cat"). He's Jake's "nemesis," but we all know that they're practically best friends. </p>
