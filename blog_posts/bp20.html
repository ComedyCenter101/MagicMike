					<h2> Vanessa Bayer </h2>

					<div class="row caststats">
						<div class="col-md-6">
							SNL Cast Member from 2010-2017 (Seasons 36-42) <br>
							Guest Appearance: "Manhunter" (S7E1); "The Jimmy Jab Games II" (S7E2); "Debbie" (S7E3)
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							Best Quote: "I can't do competitions. I'm anti-dexterous... It's when neither hand is good at anything."
						</div>
					</div>
					<p> 
						Vanessa Bayer plays Debbie, the beat-cop who was partnered with the demoted Captain Holt and a general mess. Chaotic, insecure, and really needs a hug, Debbie is simply trying her best, tackling life and mundane mediocrity one step at a time. However, after being encouraged by Boyle to chase her dreams during the Jimmy Jab Games, she may or may not have stolen a bunch of cocaine and machine guns and kidnapped Jake and Rosa. Awkwardly and absurdly funny, Debbie had a vibrant personality and made a weirdly charming villain.

							SNL Cast Member from 2005-2013 (Seasons 31-38) <br>
							Guest Appearance: "New Captain" (S3Ei)
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							Best Quote: "I have made promises to my superiors that I most certainly cannot keep. That's why I need you idiots to work twice as hard. No, no, no, strike that, four times as hard. No, no no, strike that! I need you morons to work eight times harder that you've ever worked in your entire life! I'm having a heart attack. Yeah, I'm having a heart attack. Get back to work."
						</div>
					</div>
					<p> 
						Bill Hader brought his naturally lively personality to <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i> as Captain Seth Dozerman as Captain Holt's replacement. Orderly, fussy, and borderline lunatic, Dozerman is all about "efficiency, efficiency, efficiency." He drove the precinct up the wall with his extreme work ethic and used his Dozer-pad tablets to enforce his strict and unrealistic deadlines. While Dozerman would be a terror in real life, his caricatured personality and screen time, unfortunately, came to an end when he found Jake and Amy making out in the evidence room and had a heart attack.

					<div class="row caststats">
						<div class="col-md-6">
							SNL Cast Member from 1990-1994 (Seasons 16-19) <br>
							Guest Appearance: "Casecation" (S6E12)
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							Best Quote: "I didn't get his name, but he was very attractive. Antonio Banderas could play him in a movie. What has he been doing lately? You know what? He should be on 'Outlander.'"
						</div>
					</div>
					<p> 
						Sweeney plays a small role in "Casecation" as Pam, the sweet and slightly bothersome patient. Jake and Amy, both swamped with work, celebrated their anniversary guarding a comatose patient at the hospital. Pam kept on interrupting their date night, and while it was seemingly harmless and innocent, the sweet old lady turned out to be the surprise villain of the episode, hired to blow up the patient they were protecting.

					<h2> Jorma Taccone </h2>

							SNL Writer from 2005-2014<br>
							Guest Appearance: "Coral Palms Pt. 1" (S4E1)
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							Best Quote: "Damn, Greg, you are killing it as assistant manager. I mean, having the idea to have people come in at 9:00 a.m. that has really helped business."
						</div>
					</div>
					<p> 
						While his role was short and somewhat insignificant, Jorma Taccone reunited with his <i>The Lonely Island</i> bandmate as Taylor, the laid-back and carefree manager of <i>Fun World</i>, Holt's place of employment when he was under Witness Protection. While his character only made brisk appearances in the episode, Taccone did also contributed to the show by directing the Season 1 episode "Thanksgiving".

					</div>
					<div class="row caststats">
						<div class="col-md-6">
							SNL Writer since 2005-2014 <br>
							Guest Appearance: "Show Me Going" (S5E20)
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							Best Quote: "Well, well, well. If it isn't Jake Peralta, my old [walks into a water cooler] Rogers! It happened again! I told you to keep the walkways clear! You're gonna regret this, Peralta! [walks into a wall] Ah!"
						</div>
					</div>
					<p> 
						The final member of <i>The Lonely Island</i>, Akiva Schaffer played Brett Booth, the scorned detective with a grudge against Jake after he accidentally shot a rubber bullet in his eye. Booth leads a multi-state task force that Jake wants to join, and thus, the bitter detective tries and fails to show his superiority. Lacking depth perception after the accident, he bumps into a water cooler and mistakes another officer for Peralta.
