				<p>With Valentine's Day coming up, it felt appropriate to celebrate one of the best relationships on TV right now. Peraltiago, the <i>very</i> catchy ship name for Jake Peralta and Amy Santiago, sets a high standard for fictional <i>and</i> real relationships. Michael Schur and Dan Goor have been incredibly successful with incorporating love and romance into their shows with notable couples like Ben and Leslie, Eleanor and Chidi, and the very iconic Jim and Pam on <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, <i>The Good Place</i>, and <i>The Office</i> respectively, and Peraltiago clearly is no exception. <iframe width="560" style="float:right" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oIuBSofOgs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
				<p> Taking a quick step back, behind the scenes, the producers were already confident that Peraltiago would be incredibly successful when Melissa Fumero proved that she was the only one who could improv with Andy Samberg so well. In a screening before the pilot aired, the audience even said that their chemistry was "through the roof." So, yeah, the casting itself already set the couple up for success, but it truly is the script and the way that the writers managed their story arc that made their romance one that was so utterly beautiful and unforgettable. </p>
				<p> Like many other television couples, Jake and Amy did not get together right away and stumbled through some barriers before pursuing a relationship. What is particularly special, however, was that their relationship arc managed to be interesting and captivating while avoiding cliches and the unnecessary drama of a will-they-won't-they storyline. Even more, when those will-they-won't-they couples eventually get together, their chemistry and relationship eventually die as the suspense and tension fade. <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i>, on the other hand, managed to keep the viewers rooting for them the entire way and kept their relationship fresh without compromising their stability.</p>

				<p> <iframe style="float:left" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxGR473vyfk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				Take Teddy for example. While a little jealous, Jake respected Amy's relationship and didn't try to make any unwanted advances on her (unlike Jim and Pam, who, while iconic in their own right, was somewhat problematic). He told her how he felt and left it at that. The show didn't put us through an unnecessary love triangle, other than a somewhat awkward dinner, but overall, the situation was dealt with unproblematically. </p>

				<p> Beyond simply avoiding unnecessary drama, the other essential component is their mutual support and love. Proving that opposites sometimes really do attract, they bring the best out of each other while managing to respect <i>and</i> love their differences and quirks. In fact, they start to understand and explore each other's interests with Jake reading the Harry Potter series and watching a documentary on feminism and Amy trying to love orange soda and Die Hard. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y4CBCcEeiRo" frameborder="0" style="float:right" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

				<p> Like any healthy relationship, they push each other to their greatest potential. This might be best exemplified in the Season 4 episode "Chasing Amy" in which Jake sets the bar high for every other subsequent TV relationship. When she starts having doubts about taking the Sergeant's Exam and what it might mean for their relationship, Jake tracks her down and tells her "Look, you can't be afraid to be successful. You're too good for that." While being a supportive boyfriend seems like the bare minimum (and it kind of is), it's still extremely refreshing to see a male character so comfortable in his masculinity and support his significant other, even when she may be (and does become) his boss.
				</p>
				<p>Now, of course, there are several other examples of healthy relationships on TV. As mentioned, Schur did a great job with Ben and Leslie as well as Andy and April on <i>Parks and Rec</i> and Eleanor and Chidi on <i>The Good Place</i>. Without going into a debate about which couple is better (since they're all amazing in their own way), Jake and Amy still definitely set a precedent of the right way to depict relationships in pop culture and exemplifies that relationships can be fresh and captivating without being problematic. </p>
