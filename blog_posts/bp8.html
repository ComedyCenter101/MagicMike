			<h1> Jacob Peralta: Musical Genius </h1>
			<h5> Jake Peralta is a man of many talents, and his countless weird but fabulous songs are a clear indication of that. From the iconic <i>Backstreet Boys</i> cold open to his several duets with Doug Judy, here are some random scenes in which Andy Samberg really lets his vocals shine. </h5>
			<img class="mainpic" alt="Jake Sings" src="images/bp8.jpg">
			<!actual content>
			<div class="bpcontent">
				<p>First and foremost, Andy Samberg is a beautiful and talented human being who, in addition to being a fantastic actor and comedian, is a phenomenal musician. He's in the comedy musical group <a href="http://www.thelonelyisland.com/" target="lonelyisland"> The Lonely Island</a> and has been nominated and won numerous awards for his work on music videos and Digital Shorts on Saturday Night Live, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K3moixkvKU" target="shyronnie">"Shy Ronnie"</a> (featuring Rihanna) and the iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt0spqQtMKg" target="box">"D*** In A Box"</a> starring Justin Timberlake. So clearly, in addition to his many other otherworldly attributes, Samberg has a unique and brilliant music gift and an amazing set of vocals, and we are blessed to see that talent play out in <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i>. </p>
				<p> And so, here are <a href="https://youtu.be/rb8BCNPRrCM" target="moresongs"><i>some</i></a> of the countless notable, memorable, and highly amusing scenes in which Jake likes to sing, and he likes to sing a lot (which is perfect because I like to hear him sing, and I like to hear him sing a lot). These scenes are short, very short, but the snippets are beautiful nonetheless. </p>

						<p>Or in which Jake tries to annoy the suspect into talking (spoiler: it didn't work). Kudos to Kid Cudi for not smiling because I spit out my water the first time I watched the scene. There's really something melodic in the synconity of the guitar and his voice.</p>

						<p>The only silver lining to the maggots living in his very dirty desk is that it's a great death metal song. His facial expression really makes the scene, and The Lonely Island should definitely release a metal song. </p>

						<p>The best <i>Brookyln Nine Nine</i> episodes are undoubtedly the ones with Doug Judy. This touching tribute from Mangy Carl to his fallen savior features a key change so beautiful that God gave him a high five. </p>

						<p>Or in which Jake may not have been the greatest friend, but the rhyme he and Stevie made was absolute fire. Charles' punchline would have been amazing though, if only they didn't, y'know, forget him. </p>

						<p> The iconic cold open has its very own separate fanbase and understandably so. From the moment, he says "Backstreet Boys, I’m familiar," Jake really guarantees that the scene will be a memorable one.  The way he slowly loses himself into the song, the way that they effortlessly but somewhat awkwardly harmonize, the way that Number Five really killed his part (and the girl's brother); it's just perfection. </p>

						<p> They're absolutely right; you just cannot sit in karaoke room silently and <i>not</i> sing. The way that Jake and Judy harmonize is amazing, and once again, their facial expressions really make the scene. </p>
