			<h1> Leslie Knope: Inspirational AF  </h1>
			<h5> The epitome of girl power and feminism, Leslie Knope is certainly one of the best female characters depicted on TV. Beyond simply being a good role model for young girls, Leslie's just generally a wondrous example of what it means to be a good human being. Here's a list of 5 times she tried to pass that goodness onto us.</h5>
			<img class="mainpic" alt="Leslie Thumbs Up" src="images/bp12/bp12.png">
			<!actual content>
			<div class="bpcontent">
			<p> An optimistic ball of positivity and sunshine, Leslie Knope is a force to be reckoned with. She has big dreams and ambitions and, despite working in an industry infamous for its demoralization and corruption, she manages to stay true to herself and her morals, all while fighting for the greater good. There's truly no character quite as inspiration as Leslie, and there's definitely lots of life lessons to be learned from the seven seasons of <i>Parks and Rec</i>.</p>


<h2>Confidence</h2>
<img alt="I am big enough to admit that I am often inspired by myself."  src="images/bp12/confidence.png">
<p>Quote: “I am big enough to admit that I am often inspired by myself.”</p>
<p>It's incredibly easy to lose ourselves in a world that preaches perfection, and it's even easier to lose our motivation when all we want to do is take a nap and binge Netflix all day. Leslie reminds us to take pride in our accomplishments because <i>damn</i> we've certainly come a long way, and sometimes the best inspiration comes from within. </p>

<h2>Priorities</h2>
<img alt="We have to remember what’s important in life: friends, waffles, and work. Or waffles, friends, work. But work comes third."  src="images/bp12/priorities.png">
<p>Quote: “We have to remember what’s important in life: friends, waffles, and work. Or waffles, friends, work. But work comes third.”</p>
<p>Without trying to get too political (because I can and have written essays about this), we live in a society that emphasizes work to an excessive degree that our obsession becomes unhealthy. Thus, Leslie, an ambitious woman who loves her work and profession, reminding us to prioritize the things that truly make us happy (i.e friends and waffles) is a needed wake-up call to enjoy the shortness and fragility of life the right way. </p>

<h2></h2>
<img alt="I love you and I like you" src="images/bp12/love.jpg">
<p>Quote: "I love you and I like you" </p>
<p> Ben and Leslie are undoubtedly one of the best couples that truly depict a healthy and loving marriage (throwback to that Jake and Amy <a href="bp10.html" target="bp10">post</a> from a couple of weeks ago). And here, they teach us the importance of <i>liking</i> your partnering in addition to loving them. Love and like are both complex emotions that equate to different relationships (for example, I love my siblings but I do not like them), but Leslie and Ben show that combining the two ensures that a relationship stays as happy and supportive as possible.</p>

<h2>Optimism</h2>
<img alt="What I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring really loudly at me." src="images/bp12/optimism.jpg">
<p>Quote: "What I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring really loudly at me."  </p>
<p>Working in the public sector can be rather...challenging, something that many, especially those who work in the service industry, can attest to. Human beings are good; some just tend to be unreasonable and stubborn, proving that common sense is not that common. It's terribly easy to want to scream into a pillow and rant about the downfall of humanity after a few select incidents, but—as Leslie, the ever-optimistic role model—reminds us, humans are good. They care. They just tend to care about trivial and unimportant matters, but still, they care. </p>

<h2>Individuality</h2>
<img alt="One person's 'annoying' is another person's 'inspiring and heroic.'" src="images/bp12/individuality.png">
<p>Quote: "One person's 'annoying' is another person's 'inspiring and heroic.'" </p>
<p> Much of TV is filled with satirized and overdramatic characters with traits exaggerated to the extremity, and <i>Parks and Rec</i> is no exception. While our world certainly isn't as bingeable and enjoyable as <i>Parks and Rec</i>, it's still nice to enjoy our various quirks and mannerisms. And while some people may not seem to enjoy our different traits and personalities, what's important is to surround ourselves with people who do. It's a big big world with infinite possibilities, so we shouldn't limit ourselves to the mediocre just because the dull thinks it's "annoying." </p>
