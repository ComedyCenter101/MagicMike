							Best Quote: "Aw, that's too bad, bud. But at least you have people that wanna come and visit you. My family hasn't been to see me since my trial. You eat nine people, and all of a sudden they 'don't know who you are anymore.'" 
						</div>

					<p> 
						Meadows plays Caleb, Jake's cellmate when he went to prison in Season Five. While seemingly harmless and sweet, Caleb proves to be one of the more dangerous inmates there, a cannibal that both saved and tried to eat Jake. Cheerful, happy-go-lucky, and a true enigma, Caleb quickly became a fan-favorite and returned in Season Six to help Jake and Boyle catch a serial killer.

						</div>
					</div>
					<p> 
						My favorite character in the show by far, Mlep(clay)nos has a chaotic energy that is frankly admirable and hilarious. His appearances were short, but all of them were definitely memorable. He first appeared in the pilot, making him the first SNL cast member to guest star on the show, and Mlepnos unexpectedly takes a picture of the victim when the detectives try to question him. He later bonds with Jake over a song from his home country of "Leirkrakeegovnia" that celebrates a dog losing its virginity, and he made a surprise appearance at Jake and Amy's wedding playing his violin (or rather "guitar") perfectly and even shedding a few tears.

						Guest Appearance: "The Slump" (S1E3)

						<div class="col-md-6">
						Best Quote: "We have a black president; why can't black people sell drugs?... Black people CAN sell drugs, black people CAN sell drugs!" 
						</div>
					</div>
					<p> 
						Paying the character of "Steven," Pete Davidson attends the precinct's program that encourages kids to become junior police officers (or as Rosa charmingly puts it, "snitches"). He, with the help of Gina, gives Amy and Rosa a hard time during the seminar, participating in a chant promoting drug dealing, much to Holt's dismay. He later mockingly autotunes Rosa's threatening speech.

						</div>

					<p> 
						Chaotic, wild, and a general mess, Kate Peralta is Jake's half-sister who flies to New York to meet Jake. On the plane ride, she punched a stewardess and vaped near a kid, causing her to meet her detective brother while being dragged in, handcuffed. She exhibits other problematic behavior, such as putting glass in her food to get out of paying for it, and Jake even flies her deadbeat ex-boyfriend in so that she would leave. In the end, however, they make up and agree to keep in touch. 
					</p>
						<p> Interestingly enough, during their time on SNL, Nasim Pedrad starred in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41rYg-GQYVk" target="snl">sketch</a> called "My Brother Knows Everything" in which she played a younger sister obsessed with her older brother, appropriately played by Andy Samberg. </p>

					<h2> Maya Rudolph </h2>

						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							Best Quote: "I don't know. I mean, I met someone, okay, and, um I mean, it's not my husband, I mean, nothing's happened yet, but my entire body is on fire. He's Cuban." 
						</div>
					</div>
					<p> 
					Maya Rudolph plays Karen Haas, the U.S Marshall who tried her best to keep Jake and Holt under control. They meet in her car to review their aliases like where Holt/Greg went to college (Ohio State with a major in Communications, much to Holt's chagrin) and what Jake/Larry's favorite movie is (<i>Failure to Launch</i> and definitely not <i>Die Hard</i>). In the next episode, she appears in the Cold Open, ranting to Greg and Larry about, well, cheating on her husband with someone who is "<i>really</i> young." It's weird, it's somewhat inappropriate, but it's <i>so</i> good, and it's a shame we don't see Karen more.
