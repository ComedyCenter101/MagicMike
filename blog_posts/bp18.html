			<h1> Four Other Schur Shows That You Should Definitely Check Out </h1>
			<h5> Michael Schur may have created iconic and timeless masterpieces with <i>The Office</i>, <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, and <i>Brookyln Nine-Nine</i>, but he has some other notable shows that definitely deserve your attention.</h5>

				<h3>The Good Place</h3>
				<img class="showpic" alt="The Good Place Poster" src="images/bp18/goodplace.jpg">
				<p> <b><a class="syn" href="https://thegoodplace.fandom.com/wiki/The_Good_Place" target="goodplace">Synopsis:</a></b>
				When Eleanor Shellstrop finds herself in the afterlife, she's both relieved and surprised that she's made it into the Good Place. But it doesn't take long for Eleanor to realize she's there by mistake. She hides in plain sight from the Good Place's architect, Michael, and his all-knowing assistant, Janet. Her seemingly perfect neighbors, Tahani and Jason, and open-hearted soul mate, Chidi, help her realize that it's never too late to change. With the help of her new friends—and a few enemies—Eleanor becomes determined to shed her old way of life in hopes of discovering a new one in the afterlife.</p>
				<p>Of course, we're going to start this list with <i>The Good Place</i>. A show that's just as acclaimed and brilliant as the other three legendary comedies, Schur really created a beautiful stardust milkshake with this one. 
				With appearances from Adam Scott (Ben Wyatt), Jason Mantzoukas (Adrien Pimento), and Marc Evan Jackson (Kevin Cozner), <i>The Good Place</i> has all the heart and feels that are characteristic of any Schur comedy while still providing the light-hearted laughter and optimism we need.</p>

				<h3>Abby's</h3>
				<img class="showpic" alt="Abbys Poster" src="images/bp18/abbys.jpg">
				<p> <b><a class="syn" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7768346/" target="abbys">Synopsis:</a></b>
				As the oddball cast of characters that hangs out at Abby's will tell you, everyone needs a bar to call home. Theirs just happens to be an unlicensed watering hole in Abby's backyard, where the drinks are cheap and the laughs abound. But what really makes this place so special is Abby. She's a tough cookie with no time for nonsense. She doesn't allow cell phones, earning a seat at the bar takes time, and losing a challenge means drinking a limey, sugary, non-beer cocktail -- and her regulars wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
				<p> A critically underrated show, <i>Abby's</i> only lasted for a season with ten episodes. It had so much potential: Natalie Morales, who plays the titular character of Abby, is incredibly charming, the cast has delightful personalities with an entertaining and comforting dynamic, and the premise was unique enough (an illegal, backyard bar) that a second season could've really seen the show blossom into a long-running success. 
				</p>
				<p><i>Abby's</i> is filmed entirely outdoors and in front of a live studio audience. In other words, it features a laugh track, which some people might find annoying. While it might not be as innovative or extraordinary as other sitcoms, the show is still incredibly charming and binge-able. 


				<h3>Sunnyside</h3>
				<img class="showpic" alt="Sunnyside Poster" src="images/bp18/sunnyside.jpg">
				<p> <b><a class="syn" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnyside_(American_TV_series)/" target="sunny">Synopsis:</a></b>
				Set in Sunnyside, Queens in New York City, the series follows Garrett Modi, a fictional former New York City Councilman, who finds his calling when faced with immigrants in need of his help and in search of the American Dream.</p>
				<p> Another very underrated show, <i>Sunnyside</i> too only lasted for a season. While the show had a shaky start, it held a lot of potential. As seen with <i>The Office</i> and <i>Parks and Rec</i>, the first season tends to be the worst one since the show is still trying to figure itself out. Some of the jokes did fall flat, and the main character, Garrett, was rather self-centered and selfish; however, the show didn't have the time to fully develop and perfect the rhythm nor allow the characters to grow.
				</p>
				<p> <i>Sunnyside</i>, however, did feature a rather diverse cast that didn't resort to dumb stereotypes. It touched upon immigration and the injustices within the system sensitively and subtly. Moreover, it explored the dynamics and importance of found family and friendship in society that rejects the, well, rejects. And, it was enjoyable enough that I watched the entire season in one sitting and still craved more, so make what you want out of that. </p>

				<h3>The Master of None</h3>
				<img class="showpic" alt="The Master of None Poster" src="images/bp18/master.jpg">
				<p> <b><a class="syn" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635276/plotsummary" target="master">Synopsis:</a></b>
				The show follows the personal and professional lives of Dev, a 30-year-old actor who has trouble deciding what he wants to eat, much less the pathway for the rest of his life. Dev's story takes him through subjects as diverse as the plight of the elderly, the immigrant experience, and how to find the most delicious pasta for dinner.</p>
				<p> The only show on this list that I haven't personally seen, <i>The Master of None</i> stars and is written and directed by Aziz Ansari, who played the extravagant character of Tom Haverford on <i>Parks and Recreation</i>. The comedy-<i>drama</i> clearly is not a sitcom and doesn't follow the normal characteristics of a Schur show. However, it still provides the heart and humanities in an original and engaging format. </i>
				<p>The show explores and addresses contemporary issues, such as sex, gender, and race, and thoughtfully touches
				on small political and social topics in a positive and transformative way. Emotional while still being light and honest, <i>The Master of None</i> is phenomenally brilliant in shining a comedic light into modern America. </p>
